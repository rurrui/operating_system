# To Everyone
The book is called Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces  and the title is obviously an homage to one of the
greatest sets of lecture notes ever created, by one Richard Feynman on the topic of
Physics.
homage:致敬，敬意  
lecture note:演讲笔记  
译文：这本书叫做：操作系统：三个简单的部分。很显然，这个名字是为了向Richard Feynman在物理专题上创作的最棒的一系列演讲笔记致敬。  
While this book will undoubtedly fall short of the high standard set
by that famous physicist, perhaps it will be good enough for you in your quest to
understand what operating systems (and more generally, systems) are all about.  
fall short of:不足，比不上  
quest:探索  
译文：这边书毫无疑问与那位知名物理学家的高标准有一定的差距，但是或许对于你来讲，探索和理解什么式操作系统已经足够了。
